            Education helps eradicate poverty and hunger, giving people the
            chance at better lives. This is one of the biggest reasons why
            parents strive to make their kids attend school as long as possible.

          Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
          such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character
          traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
          rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the
          role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from
          indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an
          improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral
          definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may
          also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process:
          the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people.
          Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one
          generation to the next.

          Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and
          informal education. Formal education takes place in education and
          training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and
          objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most
          regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and
          commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary
          school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or
          alternative to formal education.[1] It may be structured according to
          educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually
          takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based
          settings. Lastly, informal education occurs in daily life, in the
          family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one
          thinks.

          Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training,
          storytelling, discussion, and directed research. The methodology of
          teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a variety of
          different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas. There
          are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and
          efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and
          efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for
          evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been
          recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] Global
          initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which
          promotes quality education for all.After the public school system was
          widely developed beginning in the 19th century.
